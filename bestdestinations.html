              Our holidays take you to the Atlantic coast, as well as
              blush-coloured Marrakech and the Atlas Mountains. With more than
              eight million tourists come to the country every year in search of
              a beach break with a twist. Most people choose Agadir as their
              base, and for good reason. The stretch of coast here unravels for
              six miles and basks in 300 days of sunshine a year. Having all these
              beautiful cities to visit with the warm sun and delicious food,
              you cant miss your chance to visit Morocco.

            <H2>Mauritus</H2>
            <p>
              At first glance, Mauritius looks like a close relative of the
              Caribbean Islands. Around 1,200 miles from the east coast of Africa,
              the island’s hemmed by 330 kilometres of immaculate white beaches.
              Take to the waters, meanwhile, and you'll spot pods of dolphins playing.
              The south, west and east coasts are defined by top-drawer
              beaches – one of the longest stretches of sand is Belle Mare,
              which borders a coral-protected lagoon. In the north, the shallow
              bays at Balaclava and Calodyne give themselves over to watersports
              like snorkelling and kite-surfing.

        <article id="destinationAbuDhabi">
            <H2>Abu Dhabi</H2>
            <p>Abu Dhabi’s more like a half-sibling than an identical twin to Dubai.
              It’s grown just as quickly, with the head count jumping from
              40,000 in the 1960s to 2.9 million today. Skyscrapers like the
              Capital Gate and the Etihad Towers are cut from a similar cloth
              to those in Dubai, and the Abu Dhabi Mall mimics its swanky shopping scene.
              But unlike Dubai, this place is loaded with authentic Emirati culture,
              so it’s easy to team modern sights with a dose of history.</p>
